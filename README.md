# Java-Car-Dealership
A Car Dealership System that adds and removes collection elements 

In this code, the DealershipInventory class has an instance variable inventoryList of type ArrayList<String> which stores the dealership's inventory. The class has three methods:

addVehicle(String vehicle) - This method takes a String parameter representing a vehicle and adds it to the dealership's inventory list using the add() method of the ArrayList class.
removeVehicle(String vehicle) - This method takes a String parameter representing a vehicle and removes it from the dealership's inventory list using the remove() method of the ArrayList class.
getInventory() - This method returns the current inventory list using the ArrayList class's get() method.
The main() method creates a new DealershipInventory object and adds vehicles to the inventory using the addVehicle() method. It then removes a vehicle from the inventory using the removeVehicle() method. Finally, it prints the current inventory list using the getInventory() method.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to use the ArrayList class in Java to create a dealership inventory list with adding and removing collection elements.
